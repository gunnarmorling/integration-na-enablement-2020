= Lab - Change Data Capture

In this lab you will enable Change Data Capture (CDC) for a legacy application that loads the customer orders from a comman separated value (CSV) file. This old PHP application can't be modified so there is no way to modernize it without risks. You will enable CDC on the SQL server database where the orders are stored and create a Kafka Connect deployment using AMQ streams to emit data change events to the Earth Apache Kafka cluster.

*Audience:* Enterprise Integrators, System Architects, Developers, Data Integrators

*Overview*

Apache Kafka is the de facto standard for asynchronous event propagation between microservices. Things get challenging, though, when adding a service’s database to the picture: how can you avoid inconsistencies between Kafka and the database?

Enter Change Data Capture (CDC) and Debezium. By capturing changes from the log files of the database, Debezium gives you both reliable and consistent inter-service messaging via Kafka and instant read-your-own-write semantics for services themselves.

*Why Red Hat?*

To respond to business demands quickly and efficiently, you need a way to integrate applications and data spread across your enterprise. Red Hat® AMQ—based on open source communities like Apache ActiveMQ and Apache Kafka—is a flexible messaging platform that delivers information reliably, enabling real-time integration and connecting the Internet of Things (IoT).

AMQ streams component makes Apache Kafka “OpenShift native” through the use of powerful operators that simplify the deployment, configuration, management, and use of Apache Kafka on OpenShift.

== Loading Earth Orders

It's now time to test the Change Data Capture integration.

- We will first load the CSV data into MSSQL using a PHP app
- Debezium will populate data from MSSQL into the Kafka topic

Let's get started!

=== Loading Orders File

. Download to your local system the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/dayinthelife-streaming/master/support/module-1/single-order.csv[Single Order File, window="_blank"].

. Navigate to the legacy PHP link:http://www-{user-username}.{openshift-app-host}/[Enterprise System, window="_blank"] in a new browser tab.
+
image:images/www-main.png[PHP System]

. Click on the *Choose File* button to load the _orders_ file.
+
image:images/www-choose-file.png[Choose File]

. Load the _CSV_ file you just downloaded. Click on *Open* button.
+
image:images/www-orders-file.png[Orders File]

. Now, click the *Load File* button. This will load the file orders and insert them in the database.
+
image:images/www-load-file.png[Load File]

.  Wait a few seconds for the information to load. If this is successfully completed, you will see the CSV data on the *Imported Orders* page.
+
image::images/www-imported-orders.png[Imported Orders]

=== Check Database Records

After loading the file into the system, the orders data  should be store in the MSSQL Server database. Let's check to make sure that's the case.

. Go back to the topology view of the OpenShift Developer console.

. Click on the database deployment to open the overview page. Then click on the *Resources* tab and next the _Pod_ name.
+
image:images/openshift-db-overview.png[Access Pod]

. Now, click on the *Terminal* tab to access the pod's shell.
+
image:images/openshift-db-terminal.png[Pod Terminal]
+
[TIP]
====
If you feel comfortable, you can also use the OpenShift CLI command `oc rsh` to access the database pod as well.
====

. Run the following command to access the database:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S mssql-server-linux -U sa -P Password! -d InternationalDB -Q "select top 5 * from dbo.Orders where OrderUser='{user-username}'"
----

. Check the results, should look like this:
+
image::images/openshift-sqlcommand.png[Query]

=== Check Apache Kafka Records

We checked that the database had the _orders_ data. Is now time to check that the Change Data Capture connector was able to query the transaction log and generate the Apache Kafka events to the cluster.

. Validate that the *KafkaTopics* were created.
+
--
- Expand the *Advanced* menu on the left menu bar.
- Click on *Search* to load the _resources_ search page.
- Click on the _Resource Type_ field and type 'topic'.
- Finally select *KafkaTopic*.

image::images/openshift-search-kafkatopics.png[Search KafkaTopics]

[TIP]
====
This an alternative way to search for resources in the OpenShift developer console.
====
--

. This will display the topics on the *Earth* _Kafka cluster_. You should be able to locate your `{user-username}-connect-cluster*` as well as the `{user-username}.earth.dbo.orders--*` _KafkaTopics_.
+
image::images/openshift-cdc-topics.png[CDC KafkaTopics]

[type=verification]
Were you able to see that your Change Data Capture connector has access to Kafka?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above. If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.

=== Inspect Kafka records

Time to check what information is flowing into Apache Kafka.

. Go back to the topology view. We will access one of the Kafka brokers.

. Click on the `user-cluster kafka` _stateful set_.

. Click on the *Resources* tab.

. Click on the `user-cluster-kafka-0` pod to access the details.
+
image::images/openshift-kafka-deployment.png[Kafka Pods]

. Click on the *Terminal* tab to access this pod's shell.
+
image::images/openshift-kafka-terminal.png[Kafka Pods]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat provides its own complete Apache Kakfa distribution container images. We will use the `kafka-console-consumer.sh` script to query the topics.
====

. Issue the following command to read *all* the events in the `orders` topic:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic {user-username}.db.dbo.Orders --from-beginning
----

. You should see the json output of the messages. Something like this:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
...
{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"change_lsn"},{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"commit_lsn"}],"optional":false,"name":"io.debezium.connector.sqlserver.Source","field":"source"},{"type":"string","optional":false,"field":"op"},{"type":"int64","optional":true,"field":"ts_ms"}],"optional":false,"name":"user1.earth.dbo.Orders.Envelope"},"payload":{"before":null,"after":{"OrderId":1000,"OrderType":"E","OrderItemName":"Mocha Irish Cream","Quantity":168,"Price":"4.30","ShipmentAddress":"P.O. Box 511, 4483 Ornare Rd.","ZipCode":"C5X 6L8","OrderUser":"user1"},"source":{"version":"0.10.0.Beta2-redhat-00001","connector":"sqlserver","name":"user1.earth","ts_ms":1584993092410,"snapshot":"false","db":"InternationalDB","schema":"dbo","table":"Orders","change_lsn":"00000027:00000038:0002","commit_lsn":"00000027:00000038:0003"},"op":"c","ts_ms":1584993096494}}
----

. Copy the string from the terminal.

. Open in a new browser tab `https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print`.

. Paste in the left side and click on Make Pretty so you can check the actual format of the message json payload.

. You will be able to see the `schema` field and the `payload` field.

. Under the _payload_ check you can see there is no `before` value as this was just an *insert*. 

. Type in some `Enter` keystrokes in the Kafka terminal to make space to separate the next record coming to the Topic.

. Now get back to the PHP _Enterprise Application_ where you will now *Edit* the record to produce another change in the database.

. In the main page, click on the *Order* table to get to the edit page.
+
image::images/enterprise-order-click.png[Click Order]

. You will get to the edit page. Do some changes to the order `quantity` and the `shipping address` information. 

. Click on *< Save >* to make the changes.
+
image::images/enterprise-order-edit.png[Edit Order]

. You should be able to see the *Success* green message.
+
image::images/enterprise-order-edit.png[Edit Order]

. Get back to the _Kafka broker_ terminal and check what happened. You should see a new record been received.

[type=verification]
Were you able to capture the changes in the MSSQL server database and generate Apache Kafka events using Change Data Capture?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above. If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.

[id="enabling-http-access"]
== Using Single Message Transformations (SMT)

Debezium generates data change events in a form of a complex message structure. Each event consists of three parts:

- metadata, comprising the type of operation, information on the event source, a timestamp, and optionally transaction information
- the row data before change
- the row data after change

Debezium provides a single message transformation that crosses the bridge between the complex and simple formats, the ExtractNewRecordState SMT.

The SMT provides three main functions. It

- extracts the after field from change events and replaces the original event just with this part

- optionally filters delete and tombstone records, as per the capabilities and requirements of downstream consumers

- optionally adds metadata fields from the change event to the outgoing flattened record

- optionally add metadata fields to the header

The SMT can be applied either to a source connector (Debezium) or a sink connector.

=== Edit the connector configuration

. Get back to the Search page and look for the `KafkaConnector` resource.

. Select the `orders-connector` and delete it.

. Click on create new KafkaConnector and replace the editor YAML with the following code:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaConnector
metadata:
  name: order-connector-smt
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: debezium
spec:
  class: io.debezium.connector.sqlserver.SqlServerConnector
  tasksMax: 1
  config:
    connector.class: "io.debezium.connector.sqlserver.SqlServerConnector"
    database.hostname: "mssql-server-linux.{user-username}.svc"
    database.port: "1433"
    database.user: "sa"
    database.password: "Password!"
    database.dbname: "InternationalDB"
    database.server.name: "{user-username}.smt"
    table.whitelist: "dbo.Orders"
    database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers: "user-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092"
    database.history.kafka.topic: "{user-username}.db.dbhistory"
    key.converter: "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter"
    key.converter.schemas.enable: "false"
    value.converter: "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter"
    value.converter.schemas.enable: "false"
    transforms: "extract"
    transforms.extract.type: "io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState"
    transforms.extract.add.fields: "op,table"
----

. Get back to the `Kafka broker` terminal and run the following command to get the records:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic user1.smt.dbo.Orders --from-beginning
----

. As you can see now, the records are more friendly so we can process them easily in the next steps.
